  Quantum chess puts a unique twist on the the rulset of classical chess. 
  On top of the familar rules of regular chess, pieces in quantum chess
  can perform "split" moves that leave the piece in superposition at two
  locations. Pieces in superposition exist in a state of existing and 
  not-existing and you don't know which is which until you measure and collapse 
  the state.

  Our project supports playing a game of quantum chess against another person on 
  a cool vim-inspired command line GUI.
